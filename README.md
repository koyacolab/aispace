# Virtual Satellite

This project was inspired by the research presented in https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06280 and its practical application in the 
[Kaggle Wild Blueberry Yield Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e14) competition, 
in the [link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/inversion/make-synthetic-blueberry-yield-data).

The primary objective of this work is to adapt the mentioned technique for addressing challenges in satellite imagery, including tasks such as: generating Cloud-Free Satellite Images, creating continuous Virtual Satellite imagery, and more.

This project utilized the LLM Distilled GPT-2 version from Hugging Face because it more faster than base GPT-2, and Sophia's 2nd order optimizer was implemented for fast training and cost reduction.

The 'data' folder contains Landsat-8 harmonized imagery, chosen for its atmospheric correction, inclusion of cloud masks, and co-registration of all imagery for time-series usability during training.

Example of Landsat-8 harmonized time series images, original and masked images. Masked AOI isn't included in training data and will be generated by GPT-2 after the fine-tuning process.
